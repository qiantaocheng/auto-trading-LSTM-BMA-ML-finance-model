# Sentiment Feature Integration - COMPLETE ✅

## Issue Resolved ✅

**Problem**: After adding sentiment analysis, model prediction failed with:
```
❌ elastic_net 预测失败: The feature names should match those that were passed during fit.
Feature names unseen at fit time:
- sentiment_score

❌ xgboost 预测失败: feature_names mismatch: ['momentum_10d', 'rsi', ...] vs ['momentum_10d', 'rsi', ..., 'sentiment_score']
```

**Root Cause**: Pre-trained models were trained on 15 features, but new data includes 16 features (with `sentiment_score`).

## Solution Implemented ✅

### 1. Updated Model Inference Logic
**File**: `D:\trade\bma_models\量化模型_bma_ultra_enhanced.py`
**Lines**: 4936-4965

**Changes**:
- ✅ When `feature_names` unavailable, use **exactly 15 standard features**
- ✅ **Exclude** `sentiment_score` from model prediction (models weren't trained with it)
- ✅ **Include** proper feature validation and missing feature handling
- ✅ **Add** notification when sentiment data is available but not used

### 2. Enhanced Feature Selection
```python
# OLD (caused mismatch):
X = feature_data.drop(columns=['target', 'ret_fwd_5d', 'Close'], errors='ignore')

# NEW (fixed):
expected_features = [
    'momentum_10d', 'rsi', 'bollinger_squeeze', 'obv_momentum', 'atr_ratio',
    'ivol_60d', 'liquidity_factor', 'near_52w_high', 'reversal_5d',
    'rel_volume_spike', 'mom_accel_10_5', 'overnight_intraday_gap',
    'max_lottery_factor', 'streak_reversal', 'price_efficiency_10d'
]
X = feature_data[available_features].copy()
```

## Test Results ✅

### Sentiment Analysis Status
```
✅ Sentiment computation completed: (117, 1)
✅ Non-zero sentiment scores: 117/117
✅ Overall Sentiment Score: 99.8/100 (Grade: A+)
✅ Sentiment features computed: (117, 1) in 35.413s
```

### Feature Compatibility Test
```
✅ Market data shape: (117, 9)
✅ Factors shape: (117, 17) - includes sentiment_score
✅ Selected for model prediction: 15 features (excluding sentiment_score)
✅ No more feature mismatch errors
```

## Current System Status 🚀

### ✅ What's Working Now
1. **Sentiment Analysis**: Fully operational, generating high-quality scores
2. **Feature Generation**: 17 factors including `sentiment_score`
3. **Model Compatibility**: Pre-trained models work with new data
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing predictions continue without disruption

### 📊 Data Flow
```
Market Data → Factor Engine → 17 Features (including sentiment_score)
                                    ↓
Model Inference ← 15 Features (excluding sentiment_score) ← Feature Filter
```

### 💡 Future Enhancement Path
To use sentiment in predictions:
1. Retrain models with 16 features (including `sentiment_score`)
2. Update `feature_names` in training results
3. System will automatically use all 16 features

## System Messages You'll See ✅

### Normal Operation
```
✅ Polygon API key configured (length: 32 chars)
✅ FinBERT模型加载成功 - 准备进行真实情感分析
✅ Non-zero sentiment scores: 117/117
使用标准15个特征进行预测 (排除sentiment_score)
🔔 检测到情感特征数据 (117个非零值)
💡 提示: 可以重新训练模型以包含sentiment_score特征获得更好性能
```

### No More Error Messages
```
❌ feature_names mismatch          <- FIXED
❌ Feature names unseen at fit time <- FIXED
❌ Sentiment features empty        <- FIXED
```
