## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Windows 10+ (tested), Python 3.9–3.11 recommended
- IBKR TWS or IB Gateway running, paper/live account ready
- Polygon.io API key (Starter or above recommended)

### Install

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you do not have a requirements file yet, install the primary dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy requests matplotlib seaborn scipy statsmodels scikit-learn xgboost lightgbm ib-insync pyyaml psutil
```

### Configure

- IBKR connection: `autotrader/data/connection.json` (created automatically when saved) or use GUI fields
- Risk config: `autotrader/data/risk_config.json` (also saved from GUI)
- Stock list: `stocks.txt` (root) or DB watchlist
- Polygon API key: edit `polygon_client.py` global instance near the bottom if needed (search for `polygon_client = PolygonClient("...")`)

### Run the GUI

```bash
python -m autotrader.app
```

In the app:

- Test connection → Start Auto Trading
- “一键运行BMA模型” to run the BMA Ultra pipeline and save recommendations (Excel/CSV under `result/`)
- Use tabs for Polygon, risk settings, database, engine status, logs

### Run the BMA Model (CLI)

```bash
python 量化模型_bma_ultra_enhanced.py --start-date 2023-01-01 --end-date 2025-12-31 --top-n 200 --config alphas_config.yaml
```

Environment overrides (optional): `BMA_START_DATE`, `BMA_END_DATE`, `BMA_EXTRA_ARGS`. The model internally clamps end_date to T‑1.

## Implementation Reference

### Architectural Simplification (2025 Update)

The system has moved from complex multi-path architectures to a streamlined, fail-fast design:

**Single Data Format:** All data flows through DataFrame MultiIndex(date, ticker) - eliminating complex branching logic that previously caused alignment errors.

**Unified Configuration:** The `UnifiedConfig` class centralizes all parameters, replacing scattered hardcoded constants and complex inheritance hierarchies.

**Direct ML Pipeline:** First-layer models (XGBoost, CatBoost, ElasticNet) feed directly into Ridge Regression Stacking - no complex ensemble cascades.

### Enhanced Temporal Safety

**Strict Lag Enforcement:** Features use T-4 base lag plus safety gaps. The system validates alignment at every stage rather than relying on complex fallback mechanisms.

**Purged Cross-Validation:** Uses `unified_purged_cv_factory.py` with gap and embargo periods. The stacking meta-learner employs even stricter temporal constraints to prevent information leakage.

**Validation Gates:** Each stage includes temporal sanity checks that fail fast rather than masking errors with fallbacks.

### Production-Grade Processing

**Cross-Sectional Standardization:** The `cross_sectional_standardizer.py` handles within-date normalization, winsorization, and industry neutralization with robust statistical methods.

**Quality Monitoring:** Real-time factor quality assessment using `alpha_factor_quality_monitor.py` and `enhanced_alpha_quality_monitor.py` catches degradation before it affects predictions.

**Robust Numerics:** Enhanced numerical stability through `robust_numerical_methods.py` prevents common optimization failures and matrix conditioning issues.

### Advanced Risk Modeling

**Professional Risk Estimation:** Factor loadings use Huber regression, covariance estimation employs Ledoit-Wolf shrinkage with PSD projection, and specific risk calculation includes robust variance estimation.

**Institutional Controls:** Multiple validation layers ensure risk model quality and catch degenerate scenarios before they propagate to portfolio construction.

### Modern Execution Framework

**Smart Order Management:** Pre-execution screening covers liquidity, spreads, and volatility. Dynamic pricing uses ATR-based methods with proper tick size handling.

**Robust IBKR Integration:** SMART routing with automatic contract qualification, comprehensive error handling, and real-time vs delayed data fallback mechanisms.

### Risk‑Reward Controller (optional)

This optional module screens symbols based on liquidity metrics, average daily volume in USD, bid-ask spreads in basis points, and average true range buckets. It computes conservative limit prices near the last or previous close with proper tick size rounding, implements per-cycle and daily throttling mechanisms, and returns structured order specifications including symbol, side, quantity, and limit price.

### Polygon Client: Pagination and Backoff

The Polygon client implements robust error handling with exponential backoff for rate limit errors, processes Retry-After headers, and supports cursor-based pagination using next_url tokens to fetch complete historical datasets. The system logs detailed error information including status codes, error messages, and request identifiers for debugging purposes.

### IBKR Contracts and Routing

Contract qualification uses SMART routing by default, with fallback mechanisms to specific exchanges when qualification fails. The system attempts qualification with the primary exchange first, then falls back to a predefined list of major exchanges including NASDAQ, NYSE, ARCA, and AMEX.

### Order Submission and Stops

The system implements bracket orders with a market order parent and limit order take-profit and stop-loss children, using transmit chaining for atomic execution. An optional local dynamic stop manager can cancel and replace server-side stops based on ATR-based trailing mechanisms with time decay, allowing for more sophisticated risk management.

### Unified Config Reload (debounced)

The configuration system implements debounced reloading that only logs and reloads when configuration files actually change. The get method checks for updates every 60 seconds and only calls the full reload process when file modification times indicate actual changes, preventing excessive logging and redundant operations.

### Polygon Client

- File: `polygon_client.py`
- Full error logging with status, message, request_id
- `next_url` cursor pagination for aggs endpoints
- 429/503 exponential backoff with Retry‑After support and inter‑request delay

### Auto‑Trader (IBKR)

- File: `autotrader/ibkr_auto_trader.py`
- IB (ib_insync) connectivity, account/position sync, market data subscription
- SMART routing via `Stock(symbol, exchange="SMART")`; optional `primaryExchange` hint
- Market/limit/bracket orders; optional local dynamic stops
- Unified risk check before order submission (exposure, caps, min notional)

### GUI

- File: `autotrader/app.py` (Tkinter)
- Tabs for database, import, risk, Polygon, engine, backtest
- Global scroll and log pane scroll
- Performance optimizer routes model execution without subprocess overhead

### Unified Configuration

- File: `autotrader/unified_config.py`
- Sources: defaults, files (risk/connection), database, hotconfig (`config.json`), runtime
- Automatic file‑change detection with debounced reload
- While reading (`get()`), only reloads if files actually changed

## Configuration Details

### Connection

- `connection.host`, `connection.port`, `connection.client_id`, `connection.account_id`
- `connection.use_delayed_if_no_realtime`: fallback to delayed quotes if real‑time unavailable

### Capital and Orders

- `capital.cash_reserve_pct`, `capital.max_single_position_pct`, `capital.max_portfolio_exposure`
- `orders.min_order_value_usd`, `orders.daily_order_limit`

### Signals and Sizing

- `signals.acceptance_threshold` (e.g., 0.6)
- `sizing.per_trade_risk_pct`, `sizing.max_position_pct_of_equity`, `sizing.notional_round_lots`

### Risk Controls

- `risk_controls.sector_exposure_limit`, `risk_controls.max_correlation`, dynamic stops toggle

## Operating Notes

### Trading Hours and Filters

- Auto‑trader runs during US market hours 9:30–16:00 ET by default
- Filters include price band [$2, $800], min order value, cash reserve, daily order caps

### Routing

- Default SMART routing; manual exchange is possible by passing `primary_exchange` to `qualify_stock()` or changing `exchange` (not recommended)

### Data Quality and T‑1 Size Factor

- Risk model Size factor uses T‑1 market cap for T returns (no look‑ahead)
- Fallback to liquidity proxy if full market cap data unavailable

## Troubleshooting

- “Starting to load all configuration sources…” repeated: addressed via debounced file‑change reload
- No orders placed:
  - Not in trading hours; price not available; filters (min order value, price band) block; risk validation failed; hit daily/per‑cycle order caps
  - Check GUI risk settings; try lowering `min_order_value_usd`, `cash_reserve_pct`, raising `max_single_position_pct`
- Polygon errors: check logs for `status`, `request_id`, message; ensure API key; pagination enabled by default
